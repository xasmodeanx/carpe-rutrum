# Development History
Note: You can click on the images to play a short youtube video of the game at each stage of development!
## Initial Build:

Manually created player level

Randomized block coloring

Physics is abysmal, collisions and movement are terrible, no deaths

## Second Build
Vastly improved physics and collision detection

Death conditions! You can suffocate or fall to your death!

Game restarts upon death and teleports you back to the top

## Third Build
Levels are randomly generated with a predefined height and width

Levels contain a randomized mixture of "Sand" and "Dirt"

Tons of hard coded stuff taken out to make more extensible for next build
